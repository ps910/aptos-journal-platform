2. **Click "Send"**
3. **Paste the new account address** (or select it from your accounts)

2. **Click the three dots (⋮)** or **Settings**

## Step 5: Tell Me When Ready

Once you have the private key from the new account, just paste this information:

**Type:** "ready [paste the new account address here]"

Example: `ready 0x1234...5678`

# 🔧 Fixed: Journal Display Issues

## ✅ Problems Fixed:

### Issue 1: My Journals showing nothing
**Root Cause:** Code was using old `window.aptos.account()` API instead of proper wallet adapter

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added `useWallet` hook from `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react`
- ✅ Using `account` and `connected` from wallet adapter
- ✅ Properly filtering journals by owner address
- ✅ Using `getPlatformStats()` to get total journal count

### Issue 2: Explore Journals showing nothing  
**Root Cause:** Same as above - incorrect wallet API usage

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added proper wallet adapter integration
- ✅ Fetching all journals from blockchain using platform stats
- ✅ Proper error handling and toast notifications
- ✅ Owner detection for free reading

## 🎯 How It Works Now:

### My Journals Page:
1. Connects to your wallet using adapter
2. Gets total journal count from platform stats
3. Iterates through all journals (0 to total)
4. Filters journals where owner matches your address
5. Displays only YOUR journals

### Explore Journals Page:
1. Gets total journal count from platform
2. Loads ALL active journals
3. Displays them in a searchable list
4. Allows reading (with payment or free if owner)

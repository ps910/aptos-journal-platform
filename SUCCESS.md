## 💡 How It Works:

1. **Platform Account** (`0xdf81...42b7`): Owns the smart contract
2. **Your Wallet** (any Petra wallet): Connects and interacts
3. **Smart Contract**: Handles all journal logic on-chain
4. **Frontend**: Beautiful UI for user interaction
5. **Backend**: User authentication and data

- Platform account is separate from user wallets
- Each user pays from their own wallet
- All transactions are on Aptos testnet

## 📈 Next Steps (Optional):

1. **Deploy to production:** Use Vercel for frontend, Render for backend
2. **Switch to mainnet:** Change network config when ready
3. **Add more features:** Extend the smart contract
4. **Share with users:** Anyone can connect their wallet!
